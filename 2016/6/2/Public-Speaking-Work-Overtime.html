                        <section class="brief"><p>　　   Overtime is the amount of time someone works beyond normal working hours. But in IT companies, working overtime seems to be a standard ingredient in cooperate culture. The last few years, programmer has been highly controversial.They earn much money but spend less and die earlier than people in other careers.It does not mean that they don`t like shopping. It is just because they work all day and don`t have time to shop. So why do they always work overtime? Do they always have so much tasks to do ? According to my own internship experience and my friends`s experiences, there are always three reasons: the manager allocates task based on 10 or more working hours rather than 8 hours one day; The employee are busy with meetings, communication with their colleagues and surfing social websites, like weibo, wechat; The last reason is that they really enjoy their job. Today I won`t talk about how to arrange tasks and manage your time, I will give you some reasons to stop working overtime.</p>

<p>　<!--more--></p>

<p>　　   First, Working overtime will increase health problems. There are already several sudden death events because of working excessive overtime. Last April, a thirty six years old IT Worker , who graduated from Tsinghua University, suddenly died on flush toilets. Before the day of his death, he sent a message to his mother, which said “I am so tired!”. And last December, a group leader in Tencent suddenly died when he took a walk with his wife after a long time overtime. Besides these reported events, many studies indicate that some health problems that have been linked to long working hours, such as higher blood pressure, higher suicide rates and lower-back injury.
　　<br />
　　   Second, overtime merely reduces the efficiency instead of increasing the productivity. The productivity is not linear. The thinking behind why managers believe twice the hours results in twice the output is short-sighted and toxic. Don`t forget that we are humans and not robots. Specially, software development is a mental activity. The programmer need time to think so that they can create powerful product.If they always are busy with coding, they can not come up with creative ideas.</p>

<p>　　   Last but not the least, life is more than working and earning money, and there are friends and relatives. If you always spend so much time on getting ahead at work, you are letting other things slide in your life, such as your dream, your friendship. Every relationship needs time to manage and maintain. In other words, you’ve let your quality of life go down the toilet in exchange for a little bit more money and perhaps some praise from the boss -though you don’t always get that either. So remember that beyond the pots and pans, there should be peotry and far afield.
　　
　　   If you are a manager in IT companies, try to find new management method fitting for programmer to increase the productivity, instead of enforcing them to work overtime. If you are an employee, try to find your own way to increase efficiency instead of working overtime. Life is short, enjoy it.
